<h1>Portal-Doctor-Patient</h1>

An ASP.NET MVC app (written in Visual Studio) that is made for people (role: patients) to be able to book a consultation to a doctor, on a specified date and specialization. We started from Regina Maria's app (https://www.reginamaria.ro/) and tried to develop a new one by our ideas. In our app, people can create an account with their email or with facebook, they can save some important details (as kg, allergies etc.), book a consultation to a doctor, see their consultation history and cancel each one if they want to. Doctors and Admin have many other features that you may discover using our Portal Doctor Patient app.

<h3>Backlog Creation</h3>
We also used the github feature for backlog, switched tasks when it needed to. Unfortunatly, we didn't make any screenshot in the middle of the process, only after we almost finished the tasks.

<h3>MVC Design Pattern</h3>

As the app is made in ASP.NET MVC we used a design pattern from the begging. "MVC is a design pattern used to decouple user-interface (view), data (model), and application logic (controller). This pattern helps to achieve separation of concerns." (source: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/mvc)
